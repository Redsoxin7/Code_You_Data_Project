# Code_You_Data_Project
This project is based on using a dataset to showcase the use Pandas. The readme will be updated to 
show the progress of the assignment and eventually to meet the requirements for submitting the 
completed assignment. The assignment will be completed using a Jupyter Notebook running in VS Code.

## Objective:
Determine if job growth in the Computer field in Kentucky will be greater than the growth in other occupations. Occupations specified by their Standard Occupational Classification(SOC).
## Data Source:
The data is from the Kentucky Center for Statistics (https://kystats.ky.gov/Reports/Reports)  
Specific dataset: https://bit.ly/OccOutData-25

##Summary
This was an excellent opportunity to finally internalize a lot of the material we've been covering in class and in our homework. As I troubleshot my numerous errors, issues and misunderstandings I was exposed to a lot of good resources to answer questions and help when it was getting frustrating. Bottom line, I feel I understand panda's dataframes and Python functions at much better level then before.

As far as what I concluded from the data: The growth in the Computer industry will be solid for the next decade. The downside was, per the data, there just aren't as many computer industry jobs as many of the other industries in Kentucky.
